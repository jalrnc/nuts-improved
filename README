*** NUTS 3.1 readme file ***

This version has a major feature that the previous release did not which
is the cloning facility. See the documentation for more details.

Before I proceed a number of people have mentioned that the documentation
with NUTS isn't all that good. Well , you're right , its not, because I hate
writing it. Anyway , most of you will be smart enough to figure out anything
I havn't mentioned by yourselves. Now onwards with the waffle...

Compiling...

I had thought of dividing this version of NUTS up into separate source files
then compiling and linking them together using a makefile but in the end
I decided that it there was very little point as the code isn't that large
and once its compiled its unlikely to be done again unless you decide to
hack it about a bit or more to a different system.
This particular version of the software was developed in parallel on 
HP-UX 10.01 using the ANSI compiler and Linux 1.2.13 using gcc 2.5.8 so 
there should be no probs with either of these. The talker should also compile
fine on AIX and OSF/1 (I hope).
	Generally you'll just need to enter "cc nuts300.c" to compile though
for HP-UX you need to type "cc -Ae nuts300.c". 
Please note that you NEED the ANSI compiler for HP-UX, the bundled K&R one
is useless.

Running...

The talker comes with a config file ready made (datadir/config) which will
be a good starting point for you. There are some network addresses in there
but they are more of a guide as to how to set up talker links rather than
being genuine links themselves. 
	To start the talker just type "go" and it will boot and automatically 
run itself in the background. All its actions are written to the syslog file. 
To log in you then just telnet to port 7000 and log in as "fred" with the 
password "test" as this is an account set up with GOD status. The "go" script
assumes the executable is called a.out.

I have included a 2nd config file called config2. This is so you can set up
another talker (by copying the files from this current one) and have them
link together. The only file that need to be different is the config file.
Move config2 into the 2nd datafiles directory as config and run the 2nd 
talker.

More detailed information is in the specific documentation in the DOCS
directory.

And finally a request...

Could you please leave the credits in the code (.help credits) and also
don't change the version so much that it doesn't say NUTS anymore when a user
does the .version command. I find it annoying that after I've spent
months of time working on this software someone comes along , changes a few 
commands then pretends its all their own work. If you have a problem
with any references to my name or NUTS being on your talker then don't use my
software, its that simple, go write your own from scratch. This software
is freeware , it is *NOT* public domain, I retain copyright and will defend
it if needs be.
