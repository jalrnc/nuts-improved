A Note from the New Author
--------------------------

Neil Robertson has decided to pass the baton to someone else in the
maintenance and development of the NUTS software.  The NUTS-based
talker community owes many thanks to Neil for his efforts and time
spent on this software.

As the new developer of NUTS, I will make every effort possible 
(time-permitting) to continue the usefulness of this program.  This
is not in any way ignoring the fun factor with this program, I believe
that it provides the medium for a great deal of entertainment both for
any would-be sysops and also users.

As of version 2.1.1, all bugs reports and suggestions should be addressed
to me at sven@borderbase.utep.edu.  I appreciate any constructive comments,
but if you wish to make unproductive comments ("this code is no good",etc)
please keep them to yourself.  All such messages will be routed to /dev/null.

Thank you

P.S.  Questions about NUTS 2.1.0 and earlier should be addressed to
      Neil Robertson at neil@realtime.demon.co.uk


A rough guide for would-be sysops.
-----------------------------------

This is NUTS 2. Even though it appears the same as NUTS 1.x from the users
point of view (bar some extra commands and slight changes) it has been 
changed quite radically under the skin. To compile the program type
"cc nuts211.c" and to run just type "a.out" or whatever name you give it.
This software is guaranteed to compile on AIX & OSF/1 and Mach (NeXT)
and should compile on SunOS & HP-UX. As for other unix's I haven't a clue.


Format of the INITFILE:

<port number> <no. of areas> <atmos on> <logging_on> <allow new> <mess life>
<room name> <link> <status>
.
.
.
.

The port number is the number of the port the talker runs on.
The no. of areas is the number of areas you have defined (max 26)
Atmos on is 1 or 0 depending on whether you want the atmospherics on or not.
Ditto above for system logging.
If allow new = 1 then new id's can be created else if 0 they can't.
Mess life is how many days messages remain on the message boards befor being
automatically erased.

You then define the room names, their links to other rooms (using letters) and
their status.

Status = 0 - room can be set by uses to either private or public
         1 - room is fixed to public
         2 - room is fixed to private (ie for sysop (Wizards & gods) only use)


Files in USERDIR:

Using Fred as an example we could have the following files..
Fred.D , Fred.M , Fred.P. They are all text files and they contain the 
following data. Fred.M contains Freds mail, Fred.P contains Freds profile
and Fred.D contains his userdata which has the following format:

<last logged in time>
<last site logged in from>
<user description>
<user level (0-2)>

The rest you should be able to work out for yourself. Some final things to note
are that use passwords are now encrypted and the user status is no longer
contained in the password file and the data directory is no longer specified
on the command line but stored as a macro in the program. There is also a
second message of the day on logging in.

I have set up a user called "Fred" who has the password "test" and use level
of God so log in has him first to play around.

You should be able to work the rest out for yourself.

Have fun.
