A rough guide for would be sysops.
-----------------------------------

NUTS 2.2 has one major change from NUTS 2.1 other than some new commands.
The user levels have changed as there is now one extra level - NEWBIE
which is level 0. The other 3 levels have been shifted up so user is
level 1, wizard is level 2 and god level 3. Bear this in mind if you are 
upgrading from 2.1

To compile this program just type "cc nuts220.c" and to run just type "a.out" 
or whatever name you give it.
This software is guaranteed to compile on AIX, OSF/1, Mach (NeXT) and
Linux 1.0 (with some warnings).
and should compile on SunOS & HP-UX. As for other unix's I haven't a clue.


Format of the INITFILE:

<port number> <no. of areas> <atmos on> <logging_on> <allow new> <mess life>
<room name> <link> <status>
.
.
.
.

The port number is the number of the port the talker runs on.
The no. of areas is the number of areas you have defined (max 26)
Atmos on is 1 or 0 depending on whether you want the atmospherics on or not.
Ditto above for system logging.
If allow new = 1 then new id's can be created else if 0 they can't.
Mess life is how many days messages remain on the message boards befor being
automatically erased.

You then define the room names, their links to other rooms (using letters) and
their status.

Status = 0 - room can be set by uses to either private or public
         1 - room is fixed to public
         2 - room is fixed to private (ie for sysop (Wizards & gods) only use)


Files in USERDIR:

Using Fred as an example we could have the following files..
Fred.D , Fred.M , Fred.P. They are all text files and they contain the 
following data. Fred.M contains Freds mail, Fred.P contains Freds profile
and Fred.D contains his userdata which has the following format:

<last logged in time>
<last site logged in from>
<user description>
<user level (0-3)>

The rest you should be able to work out for yourself. Some final things to note
are that use passwords are now encrypted and the user status is no longer
contained in the password file and the data directory is no longer specified
on the command line but stored as a macro in the program. There is also a
second message of the day on logging in.

I have set up a user called "Fred" who has the password "test" and use level
of God so log in has him first to play around.

You should be able to work the rest out for yourself.

Have fun.
