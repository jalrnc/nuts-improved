*** README for 3.3.2 ***

Read the DOCS/diffs file for update information.

Welcome to NUTS if you're a first time user. Hopefully you'll find it a
simple system to use thanks to the helpfiles and the documentation , if not
then please feel free to email me at the address at the end of this file.
Before I continue though I must stress that I WILL NOT SORT OUT BUGS OF YOUR
OWN MAKING OR WRITE CODE FOR YOU! If you write your own code or alter my
code and fuck it up thats your problem, I have my own projects to do and I
am *not* interested in sorting out yours. I've had one too many emails from
people asking me to sort out the mess they've made and I'm getting rather sick 
of it. However, despite me putting this request in the 3.3.1 docs some people 
have seen fit to ignore it so heres an added incentive: mail me about your cock
ups and not only will I not reply to the mail but I will keep a note of your 
email address and I will not reply to *any* mails you send me even if its about
problems with *my* code. Its your choice. 

I've found out about a problem with the colour on a SCO console. For some 
reason the terminal reset code does not reset the colours so they stay 
effective until another colour is specified. No doubt there is a specific code 
to do a colour reset but at the moment I don't know what it is. If you 
are using SCO and have trouble you'll just have to make do with colour off or 
use an xterm under X windows. Sorry. If anyone does know the code could you
email it to me.

Now go and read the DOCS/compiling file for info on how to get started if 
you're new to NUTS and all the other files there will be usefull in time also.
The auth lookup stuff that was in the readme in the 3.3.1 distribution has been
moved to its own file in DOCS.

NB: If anyone is also interested in MUDs I've written a MUD system called 
    Ogham - ftp.ccs.neu.edu:/pub/mud/servers/misc/ogham/ogham260.tar.gz
    Its not as complex as perhaps LPmuds or Dikumuds are but if you know C and 
    want to set up a low to medium complexity mud then this is just what you 
    need :) The final release of Ogham + mudlib (2.6.0) was released in early 
    June but there is now a patch release which will upgrade you to 2.6.1
    called ogham261_patch.tar.gz but I'm hoping to release 2.6.2 soon.
