Read the DOCS/diffs file for update information.

OK , so 3.2.1 was going to be the final version. So I lied (but not 
intentionally :) This version has a number of bug fixes as usual and some
new features. Can't think of much else to say about it really so I'll leave
it at that.

I've tried to create a newsgroup called alt.talkers.nuts but it doesnt
seem to be propagating very fast. Anyway , hopefully it'll arrive at
your site at some point :) Theres always alt.talkers in the meantime. 
I will crosspost anything I put on alt.talkers.nuts to alt.talkers for the
time being.

Now go and read the DOCS/compiling file for info on how to get started if 
you're new to NUTS.

NB: If anyone is also interested in MUDs I've written a MUD system called 
    Ogham - ftp.ccs.neu.edu:/pub/mud/servers/misc/ogham/ogham260.tar.gz
    Its not as complex as perhaps LPmuds or Dikumuds are but if you know C and 
    want to set up a low to medium complexity mud then this is just what you 
    need :) The final release of Ogham + mudlib (2.6.0) was released in early 
    June but there is now a patch release which will upgrade you to 2.6.1
    called ogham261_patch.tar.gz.
