Read the DOCS/diffs file for update information.

This is going to be the last major release of NUTS 3. There may well be further
patch releases if needs be (eg 3.2.1) but as far as features goes , this is
it. There will be no version 3.3 though maybe in a few years I may do a 
version 4 if I get bored. Certain things which I had suggested I might put
in this version are missing - saving statistics for instance - this is simply
because I couldn't be bothered to put them in. :) Other things either required
too much rehacking of the code (eg mail forwarding) or were simply too complex
for me to bother doing (eg user defined rooms) though of course there is 
nothing to stop any of you lot implementing them :)

Now go and read the DOCS/compiling file for info on how to get started.
