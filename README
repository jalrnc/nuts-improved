Read the DOCS/diffs file for update information.

Welcome to NUTS if you're a first time user. Hopefully you'll find it a
simple system to use thanks to the helpfiles and the documentation , if not
then please feel free to email me at the address at the end of this file.
Before I continue though I must stress that I WILL NOT SORT OUT BUGS OF YOUR
OWN MAKING OR WRITE CODE FOR YOU! If you write your own code or alter my
code and fuck it up thats your problem, I have my own projects to do and I
am *not* interested in sorting out yours. I've had one too many emails from
people asking me to sort out the mess they've made and I'm getting rather sick 
of it. If however theres a problem with my code please feel free to email
me about it.

This versions main change is that the local port number of the user connected 
is available using .site command, is stored in the syslog and follows the
SIGN ON: when seen by wizes and above. It appears after a colon following the 
address eg ogham.demon.co.uk:1234
The reason I have done this is so manual user identity lookups can be done on 
a site if you so desire (automatic lookups means lots of extra code) to 
supposedly verify a users real identity though bear in mind that fake auth 
daemons can be easily written (about 2 hours work I'd say for an experienced 
tcp/ip C programmer starting from scratch).
To do a manual lookup telnet to port 113 on the users site (if you get a 
connection refused message they don't have an auth daemon running) and enter 
the following:

<their local port number>,<talkers port number>

So for instance if they're logging in on the talkers main port on 7000 and
their local port is 1234 enter:

1234,7000

You should see something like the following:

Trying sad.hackers.org...
Connected to sad.hackers.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
1234,7000
1234 , 7000 : USERID : UNIX : weenie     <--- The reply
Connection closed by foreign host.

As you can see the final field is the user id but if you see this...

1234 , 7000 : ERROR : NO-USER

then something is wrong. Bear in mind that this will only work while the user
is logged onto the talker so if you wish to do it do it quick! Also YOU MUST 
TELNET FROM THE SAME MACHINE THAT THE TALKER IS RUNNING ON. There ends the 
lesson on manual auth lookups. If you're wondering whether I'll put automatic
lookups in future NUTS releases (assuming there'll be any) the answer is no
as the majority of sites do not have auth daemons in the first place eg a
windows PC is very unlikely to have one :), so the effort would not be worth
it , besides doing the lookup could hang the talker if there's net lag.

Now go and read the DOCS/compiling file for info on how to get started if 
you're new to NUTS.

NB: If anyone is also interested in MUDs I've written a MUD system called 
    Ogham - ftp.ccs.neu.edu:/pub/mud/servers/misc/ogham/ogham260.tar.gz
    Its not as complex as perhaps LPmuds or Dikumuds are but if you know C and 
    want to set up a low to medium complexity mud then this is just what you 
    need :) The final release of Ogham + mudlib (2.6.0) was released in early 
    June but there is now a patch release which will upgrade you to 2.6.1
    called ogham261_patch.tar.gz.
