*** NUTS 3.1.2 readme file ***

Read the DOCS/diffs file for update information.

Yet more bugs have been nailed for this release however there are probably 
still some around , so because of this I've put an option in the config file 
called "crash_recovery". Read the doc for more information. Apparently this 
program dies horribly on IRIX 5.3 as soon as someone attempts to log in. I may
have solved it in this release but since I don't know what the problem was in 
the first place theres no way to tell.

Compiling...

I had thought of dividing this version of NUTS up into separate source files
then compiling and linking them together using a makefile but in the end
I decided that it there was very little point as the code isn't that large
and once its compiled its unlikely to be done again unless you decide to
hack it about a bit or move to a different system.
This particular version of the software was developed in parallel on 
HP-UX 10.01 using the ANSI compiler and Linux 1.2.13 using gcc 2.5.8 so 
there should be no probs with either of these. The talker should also compile
fine on AIX and OSF/1 (I hope).
	Generally you'll just need to enter "cc nuts312.c" to compile though
for HP-UX you need to type "cc -Ae nuts312.c". 
Please note that you NEED the ANSI compiler for HP-UX, the bundled K&R one
is useless.

Running...

The talker comes with a config file ready made (datadir/config) which will
be a good starting point for you. There are some network addresses in there
but they are more of a guide as to how to set up talker links rather than
being genuine links themselves. 
	To start the talker just type "go" and it will boot and automatically 
run itself in the background. All its actions are written to the syslog file. 
To log in you then just telnet to port 7000 and log in as "fred" with the 
password "test" as this is an account set up with GOD status. The "go" script
assumes the executable is called a.out.

I have included a 2nd config file called config2. This is so you can set up
another talker (by copying the files from this current one) and have them
link together. The only file that need to be different is the config file.
Move config2 into the 2nd datafiles directory as config and run the 2nd 
talker.

More detailed information is in the specific documentation in the DOCS
directory.
