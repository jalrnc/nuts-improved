Read the DOCS/diffs file for update information.

This is *it*, 3.2.1 is the final version of NUTS .. ever (probably :). Even if 
there turn out to be bugs in this version I still won't be releasing another, 
however I may keep an updated list of known bugs on the NUTS home page (see 
below). I've decided there probably won't be a version 4 as the way the 
internet is slowing down these days talkers will probably be so laggy as to be 
useless in a couple of years time (Call me a cynic , I don't care :) so there 
won't be any point :) 

I reckon I should have added a .revtell at some point but sod it,I couldn't be 
bothered. Also something that came to mind was .lock and .unlock commands 
which locked the session so that you could wander away from your keyboard for 
a while and not have to worry about some moron sitting next to you in the lab 
abusing your account. You would simply use .lock on its own to lock the session
but would have to do .unlock <your password> to unlock it. This is fairly easy 
to implement so I'll leave it up to you to sort it out :) Something else that
I thought of (if I ever do a version 4) is to have a user definable front end 
to the talker so you can control the way it looks to you and also have a simple
scripting language that would allow triggers , macros, automatic events when 
you log on/off etc and negate the need for flash clients such as TUsh.

If I get enough email persuading me to do a version 4 in a few years then I
may consider it , in the meantime the above is just a gleam in this busy
programmers eye :)

Now go and read the DOCS/compiling file for info on how to get started if 
you're new to NUTS.

NB: If anyone is also interested in MUDs I've written a MUD system called 
    Ogham - ftp.ccs.neu.edu:/pub/mud/servers/misc/ogham/ogham260.tar.gz
    Its not as complex as perhaps LPmuds or Dikumuds are but if you know C and 
    want to set up a low to medium complexity mud then this is just what you 
    need :) The final release of Ogham (2.6.0) was released in early June.
