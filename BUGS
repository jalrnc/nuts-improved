Current known bugs
==================

1) gethostbyname() in FreeBSD is not multithreaded and this can cause
   threads that use this to block if another thread is using it.

2) errno variable not set to correct value in threads on Solaris which
   gives rise to error messages (for instance on a failed connect).
   No idea how to fix this. Anyone?

3) Occasionally connects to other servers hang on server bootup (but they
   don't hang the whole server). It happens so rarely I haven't been able
   to pin down the cause.

4) Rebooting in linux causes the new process to be automatically backgrounded
   if the server was originally running off the command line (ie not a
   daemon). This is due to the linux thread model whereby each thread is
   actually a process and the auxilliary threads (processes) are effectively
   backgrounded with only the main thread being in the foreground.
   The solution to this is so ugly (involving sending a signal to the main
   thread which then does the shutdown) that you will just have to live with
   it.

5) Runtime error with old Solaris compilers as mentioned in README.

6) Rebooting fails on MacOS X with an "Operation not permitted" error. Since
   I don't have a Mac to develop on this bug will remain until someone sends
   me a patch.

7) Trying multiple connect addresses doesn't work on BSD. For some reason
   gethostbyname doesn't fill up the address list like it should. Frankly
   I couldn't give a toss, think yourself lucky I even bothered to port
   it to this fucked up OS.
