Some features guaranteed to be in 3.2...

- More commands for general system administration eg delete a user, change
  a users password etc

- Have snapshots of system stats automatically saved to file at given
  periods.



Some things I hope to include (time permitting)...

- ANSI colour (user option)

- "Copies to" functionality on sending mail

- Pipe a file to the room ie have an echo that is an entire file.



Some things which may never be done but which seem nice ideas...

- Mail forwarding.

- Ability to create rooms on the fly

- Lack of bugs



Things which are guaranteed never to get done...

- Multiple netlink traversal. I examined the problem and it meant way too
  much rehacking of the code which I simply have neither the time nor
  inclination to do.
