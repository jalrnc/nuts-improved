Here are some things I have in mind for future release but dont assume
this means I'll ever actually implement them...

- Cloning of user objects for gods so that they can be in more than one
  room at once and listen in to multiple conversations.

- Mail forwarding.

- "Copies to" functionality on sending mail

- Ability of users to traverse more than 1 remote link (this is a v. complex
  thing to code believe it or not.)

- Ban individual users from logging in from connected sites (though I'm not
  sure how much practical use this will be)

- Have various channels for wizes to talk on

- Get stats on remote system from home system
