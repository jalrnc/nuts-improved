Some things planned for 3.2 or later ....

- ANSI colour (user option)

- Mail forwarding.

- "Copies to" functionality on sending mail

- Have snapshots of system stats automatically saved to file at given
  periods.

- Pipe a file to the room ie have an echo that is an entire file.

- Ability to create rooms on the fly

Though before I start on these I intend to have a few months off to pursue
other projects...
