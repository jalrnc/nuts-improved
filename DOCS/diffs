3.0.0a (Jan 96)
------
Initial alpha release.


3.0.0  (March 96)
-----
1. Added revclr command

2. Added last_login_len element in user structure for examine command
   and saving this in the user data files makes these files incompatible with 
   the alpha version. Tough titties.

3. Various bug fixes


3.1.0
-----
1. Added cloning facilities and all associated commands - clone, destroy,
   clsay, clhear, allclones, myclones. A new field was added to the config
   file called "max_clones"

2. Added "from" command which like its unix equivalent shows who you've got
   mail from but not the actual message.

3. Added "rstat" command which gets statistics for a remote system. This 
   required the addition of the RSTAT netlink command.

4. Added a swearing prevention measure which involves the "swban" command
   and the "ban_swearing" field in the config file. This is for all would be
   big brothers out there :)

5. Upgraded the wizshout command.

6. Rewrote the search command so that now its actually of some use.

7. Added an "afk" command. This is an omission I meant to put in nuts 2 but  
   never got round to it.

8. Moved the mapfile and newsfile into the datafiles directory and the names
   of the banfiles are now stored in macros.

9. The usual bug fixes and minor code changes.


3.1.1 
-----

1. You can now specify which room message board to read with the "read" 
   command.

2. Entering "version" at the login prompt gives the software version.

3. Bug fixes and other minor "look and feel" alterations.
