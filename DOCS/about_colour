**** About the embedded colour commands ****

Colour commands can be placed in any string in the program that is used
eventually by write_user() and also in any file that is paged by the more()
function. The commands get translated into ANSI codes by these 2 functions 
before they are sent out. All the commands start with a ~ and are the
following:

RS - reset terminal to default
RV - reverse video
OL - bold
LI - blink/flash text (only the text flashes , not the background colour). This
	won't work on all terminals , some xterms simply set it to bold.

FK - set foreground colour to black
FR - foreground red
FG - green
FY - yellow (though it looks orangey brown on some systems)
FB - blue
FM - magenta/purple
FT - turquoise/bright blue
FW - white

BK - set background colour to black
BR - red
BG - green
BY - yellow
BB - blue
BM - magenta
BT - turqouise
BW - white

So if for instance you wanted some flashing magenta "hello" on a green
background followed by a non-flashing blue "world" on a black background you 
would do the following:

write_user(user,"~FM~LI~BGhello ~RS~FBworld\n");

Notice the use of the reset (RS) to reset the background to black and the text
to non-flashing. Also note that an automatic reset is sent whenever a \0 or \n 
is encountered in a string so the colours set to do not carry over to the next 
line. Currently there is no way of printing out the commands directly to
the screen instead of them producing a colour. I may put in some way of doing
this eventually if anyone ever needs it but I doubt they will.

Colour commands can be used within the talker as a user as well as in the code
so for instance you can embed them in anything you say or shout , in your
description , board messages , mail etc ... so to use the above example as
some mail you would enter...

.smail fred ~FM~LI~BGhello ~RS~FBworld

Please note however that the colour commands contribute to the length of
the string so for instance if you put in lots of colour in your description
you may find that it tells you that its too long even if it seems to you that
the actual text is rather short. There is a way around this but its tricky to
program and I can't be bothered to do it. Deal with it :)
