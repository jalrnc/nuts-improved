USER LEVELS
===========

The talker has 6 levels described below:

LOGIN:
This is only used when the user is logging in.

NOVICE:
This is the level of all new accounts and provices limited functionality.
The intention is that the user sets their email address using the "setemail"
command which is then verified by an admin and once this is done the user
is promoted to level USER by an admin using the "level" command. 

USER:
The standard level for the majority of users which provides all the necessary
functionality to use the talkers features.

MONITOR:
This is intended for users who can monitor conversations in various groups
and take action if some user is misbehaving or being rude.

OPERATOR:
This user has greater power than a monitor and can do things like create and
destroy public groups and connect and disconnect the server from other servers.

ADMIN:
An admin has full control of the talker including shutting it down, rebooting,
creating new server links etc. I would recommend that only one or two users
have access to an admin account.
