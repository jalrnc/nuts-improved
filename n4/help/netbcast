~BM*** Netbcast ***

~FTUsage:~RS netbcast [<text>]

This sends a network broadcast message to all connected servers and users on
the local server of a level >= recv_net_bcast_level. Note that just because a
message is succesfully sent does not mean that anyone at the other end will
see it or that it will be logged. If you do not enter any text after the
command you will be placed in the editor.
