~FTUsage:~RS move <user id> <group id> / here

This command will move the given user to the given group (or to your current
group if "here" is used). If your level is less than the current gatecrash
level then you cannot move a user to a group if it is private or they are
banned from it. Also you cannot move prisoners, they must be released first.
