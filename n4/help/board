~FTUsage:~RS board [<sub command> [<arguments>]]

This command enters you into the message boards sub system. If you just
enter the command on its own you will be given a listing of the current
messages and then recieve the sub command prompt. If you pass sub commands
they will be executed first and then you receive the prompt.

eg: board write "Hello world"
    board info

The board command line works in more or less the same way as the mail 
sub system and all the commands that can be used in it are available by
entering "help" when at the command prompt. Normal commands cannot be used
when in the board sub system.
