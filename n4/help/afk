~BM*** Afk ***

~FTUsage:~RS afk [lock] [<afk message>]

You would use this command to signify that you are Away From the Keyboard
doing something else and so unavailable for conversation. This will be evident
when someone does a "look" in the room or tries to "tell" you something. 
   The lock option allows you to lock the session while you are away and it 
cannot be unlocked without you entering your password or doing a remote 
disconnect.
   The message option is a short message sent to users who try to "tell" you
while you are afk and also appears in the output of the examine command.
