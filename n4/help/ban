~FTUsage:~RS ban user <user id>
       ban site <ip number> [user/server/all]

This command is used to ban local or remote users permanantly from the talker
until unbanned and also to ban sites which means that users and servers
cannot connect from them. The bans are stored in the file "banfile" (defined in
globals.h). Remote users original id's and ip addresses are stored so even
if they attempt to come via a different 3rd party server they will be
prevented.
   The optional argument with site bans indicates which type of ban it will
be: "user" means only ban users from that site, "server" means only ban
server connects from that site and "all" means ban both.
