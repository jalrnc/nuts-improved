~FTUsage:~RS look [<group id>]

This shows details about a group, including its id, name, its description,
who is in it etc. If you do not give a group id the command defaults to the
current group you are in. If any given user is invisible you will not be able
to see them unless you are a high enough level.
   All users can view all groups whether they have permission or not to join
those groups. This is because users can discern who is in a group anyway by
using the "who" command so there is no reduction in group privacy.
