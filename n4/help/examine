~FTUsage:~RS examine [<user id[@<server>]>]

This shows you details about the given user. If you are examining a user
on a local system you will see their text profile but this is not shown for
a remote user (yet). If no user id is given the examine command will show you
your own details. This functionality replaces the removed "whoami" command.
