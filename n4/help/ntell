~BM*** Ntell ***

~FTUsage:~RS ntell "<username>" <text>

This does exactly the same as the normal tell command except that it takes
a user name instead of an id number. The name must have quotes around it if
it is more than one word (has whitespace) and it can only be of a user on the
local server. Ntell to users on remote servers is not supported. If more than
one user has the given name tells will be sent to all of them. Note that
this command is case sensitive when looking up the name.

Shortcut: ">>"
