~BM*** Whois ***

~FTUsage:~RS whois "<username>"

This displays a list of logged on users who have the name given. If the name
has whitespace you must put quotes around it. Since names are non-unique (as
ids are used as identifiers) multiple users can have the same name. This
command can do pattern matching on the name.

eg: whois "*red??log?s"

See the pattern matching help for more information.
