*** COPYRIGHT ***

Could you please leave the credits in the code (.help credits) and also
don't change the version so much that it doesn't say NUTS anymore when a user
does the .version command. I find it annoying that after I've spent
months of time working on this software someone comes along , changes a few 
commands then pretends its all their own work. If you have a problem with any 
references to my name or NUTS being on your talker then don't use my software,
its that simple, go write your own from scratch. This software is freeware, it
is *NOT* public domain, I retain copyright, and since there is code in here 
that I have used in a commercial system I have written I will take legal 
action on anyone and their institution/employer who I find using it to their 
own commercial advantage.
	You are however perfectly free to modify the code to suit your needs
and distribute modified versions *BUT* if you do could you please leave my
name and the NUTS name in the code and also note the fact that it isn't 100%
original code.
