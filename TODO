                      *** Things I hope to add ***
                      ============================

Or in management speak - a "roadmap".

This is a wish list of things I hope to add to the system as long as time
and enthusiam permit. I was hoping to add IP6 in already but the shear amount
of code modifications (albeit most of them minor) and #ifdefs (since not all
platforms support it yet) required have put me off.  Its my own fault really,
I should have built it in the from start. Oh well.

Future updates:

1.4.1
-----
- Users can set own invite expire times
- Option to strip control codes from group logs
- Put checkpoints & other notifications in group logs
- Tell logging


One day 
-------
- IP6
- multiple mail recipients for mail commands
- board & mail commands exit don't go into sub prompt if called with arguments
