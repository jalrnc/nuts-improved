A rough guide fo' would be sysops.
-----------------------------------

NUTS 2.2 gots'ta one majo' change fum NUTS 2.1 oda' dan some new commands.
De usa' levels gots' changed as dere be now one 'estra level - NEWBIE
which be level 0. De oda' 3 levels gots' been shifted down so's usa' is
level 1, wizard be level 2 and god level 3. Bear dis in mind if ya' are 
downgradin' fum 2.1

To compile dis  honky code plum type "cc nuts220.c" and t'run plum type "a.  Sheeeiit.out" 
o' whuteva' dojigger ya' give it.
Dis software be guaranteed t'compile on AIX, OSF/1, Mach (NeXT) and
Linux 1.0 (wid some warnin's).
and should compile on SunOS & HP-UX. As fo' oda'  slow mo-fo's ah' aint some clue.  What it is, Mama!


Fo'mat uh de INITFILE:

<po't number> <no. uh areas> <atmos on> <loggin'_on> <allow new> <mess life>
<room dojigger> <link> <status>
.
.
.
.

De po't numba' is de numba' of de po't da damn rapa' runs on.  'S coo', bro.
De no. uh areas be de numba' of areas ya' gots' defined (max 26)
Atmos on be 1 o' 0 dependin' on wheda' ya' wants' de atmospherics on o' not.
Ditto above fo' system loggin'.
If allow new = 1 den new id's kin be created else if 0 dey kin't.
Mess life be how many days messages remain on de message bo'ds befo' bein'
automatically erased.

You's den define da damn room dojiggers, deir links t'oda' rooms (usin' letters) and
deir status.

Status = 0 - room kin be set by uses t'eida' private o' public
         1 - room be fixed t'public
         2 - room be fixed t'private (ie fo' sysop (Wizards & gods) only use)


Files in USERDIR:

Usin' Fred as an 'esample we could gots' de followin'  stashs..
Fred.D , Fred.M , Fred.P. Dey are all text  stashs and dey contain de 
followin' data.  Sheeeiit. Fred.M contains Freds mail, Fred.P contains Freds pro stash
and Fred.D contains his userdata which gots'ta de followin' fo'mat, dig dis:

<last logged in time>
<last site logged in fum>
<usa' descripshun>
<usa' level (0-3)>

De rest ya' should be able t'wo'k out fo' yo'self.  What it is, Mama! Some final wahtahmelluns t'note
are dat use passwo'ds are now encrypted and da damn usa' status be no longer
contained in de passwo'd  stash and da damn data directo'y be no longa' specified
on de command line but sto'ed as some macro in de  honky code. Dere be also a
second message uh de day on loggin' in.  'S coo', bro.

I gots' set down some usa' called "Fred" who gots'ta de passwo'd "test" and use level
of God so's log in gots'ta him fust t'play around.

You's should be able t'wo'k de rest out fo' yo'self.  What it is, Mama!

Have fun.  'S coo', bro.
