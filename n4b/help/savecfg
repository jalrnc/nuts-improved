~FTUsage:~RS savecfg [<filename>]

This command saves out the current system configuration to a filename in
a format the server can read when booting. The extension ".n4c" is appended
onto the end of the file if it is not given in the name. If a file of the
same name as the given file already exists a warning prompt is given. The
file is saved into the working directory.
    The default config file if none is given when the server is booted is
"default.n4c" which is expected to be found in whatever directory you start
the server in (usually src/)
    If no filename is given the config file used on boot is overwritten.

    Something to bear in mind when using this command is that any comments or
commented out values in the config command used to boot the server will not
be written out to the new config file.
