~BM*** Batch ***

~FTUsage:~RS batch list / run / delete <batch name>
       batch create <batch name> [include]

This allows you to create, delete and list a command batch. Command batches
are just lists of standard commands that are executed in sequence when you
run the batch , or in the case of the special "login" and "logout" batches
when you login or logout , as if you had typed the commands at the command
line. 
   There are certain restrictions on batches however, the most stringent
being that you cannot use the batch command itself from within a batch apart
from listing a batch. This is to prevent any kind of recursion. Also you
cannot automate interactive sub systems such as the mailer or board reader. 
If you call these from a batch you will be presented with a prompt and the
batch will not continue until you have exited. Please note that in the special
"logout" batch any sub systems called will be exited immediately.
   In the future I may add support for simple programming language constructs
such as if-then etc but only if demand is there from users.
