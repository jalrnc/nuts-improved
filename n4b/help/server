~FTUsage:~RS server add        <server> <ip addr> <port> <local port> <connect key>
                         [encrypted] [connect]
       server delete     <server>
       server connect    <server> [encrypted | unencrypted]
       server disconnect <server>
       server ping       <server> [continuous] | cancel 

This allows you to add, delete connect, disconnect or ping servers from the
current server list. The add fields are fairly self evident but the ip address
can be either numeric or a name address. The connect option for add forces a
connect attempt to be made immediately. If a server is deleted and is currently
connected it will be disconnected. The connect option will only work with
an outgoing list entry, the disconnect option will work with outgoing or
incoming.

  The ping option does not use an ICMP ping, rather it sends a special NIVN
packet to see if the remote server is still responding and the delay on the
network. If you add the continuous option the remote server will be pinged
every server HEARTBEAT. The cancel option cancels the ping.
eg:
    server ping n4b continuous
    server ping cancel

Only one server can be continuously pinged at a time. If you set a continuous
ping while already doing another then your current ping will be cancelled.

  The add option allows the port, local port and connect key options to be 
left blank. In this case just use "". eg:

    server add n4b localhost 1413 "" "" connect encrypyted

Encryption is optional with server connections but the default is off unless
explictly requested in these commands or in the config file. If no encrypt
option is given in the add command then encryption is switched off and can
only be switched on by disconnecting and reconnecting **. If no option
is given in the connect command then the encryption remains as it was when
last connected.

No changes are made to the configuration file by this command.

** Encryption CANNOT be switched on and off ad-hoc on a connection while it
   is live as this would require a negotiation protocol that I have not yet
   implemented though I may put this in revision 6 if I feel its worth it.
