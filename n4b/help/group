~FTUsage:~RS group create  <group id> "<group name>" [private] [fixed]
       group delete  <group id>
       group load    <group id>
       group unload  <group id>
       group monitor <group id>/none

This allows you to create, delete, load or unload a public group. Loading or 
unloading is used on prexisting groups whose directory & config files etc
already exist. Creating a group creates an entirely new group (whose id must
be unique) that will now be usable and will also be loaded on the next reboot.
Deleting a group renames the group directory so that the talker will no longer
find it but is still there in case the owner wishes to reinstate it. When a
group is unloaded/deleted all users in it are returned to their home groups.
  A user can monitor a group providing they are of a high enough level and
they are not banned from it or the group is private. They will then see 
everything that is said in that group when they are not in it. 

NOTE: Only ONE group can be monitored at a time though this may change in a
      future release.
