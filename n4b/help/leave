~BM*** Leave ***

~FTUsage:~RS leave

This command causes you to leave the session you are on on a remote server.
It performs the same function as the quit command when used on a remote server
but the crucial difference is that used on your local server it does nothing
and if used in the "/leave" format when on a remote server it will return you
back to your local server no matter how many hops away you are. The quit 
command would disconnect you completely.
