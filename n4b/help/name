~FTUsage:~RS name "<new name>"

This will change your user name. Since names are not used as identifiers on
the system you can have any name including one already used by someone else.
This only works on the server you are currently on or any subsequent servers
you may jump to from it. If you use this command on a remote server it will
NOT change your name in all the servers back down the chain that you are on.
