~BM*** Emote ***

~FTUsage:~RS emote <text>

This displays an emotion message in the users current group. This is basically
the same as the user speaking except that the text is run into the users name
and this makes it grammatically easier to express thoughs and emotions. If
the user has the NOSPEECH flag toggled on then they will not see the output
of this command. The output gets stored in the groups review buffer.

Shortcut: ";"
