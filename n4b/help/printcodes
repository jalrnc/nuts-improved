                                 Printcodes
                                 ==========

NUTS-IV printcodes are the same as those used in NUTS 3 except with a few
additions. Printcodes themselves are embedded 2 character strings that are
parsed by the NUTS 4 server and cause various modifications to the output to
occur. The strings are recognized in a string by a prepended tilda ~.

The following codes will not necessarily work on all terminals. For example
xterms hardly ever support character blinking, a Windows DOS box doesn't 
support underlining and old green/orange/b&w screen terminals obviously cannot
support colours though they may come out as different shades.

Screen codes:

   RS - Reset all settings to terminal default
   OL - Bold
   UL - Underline
   LI - Blink 
 * SN - Sound (beep)
   RV - Reverse video
 * SC - Clear screen
 * SH - Home cursor
 * LC - Clear line
 * CU - Move cursor up 1 line

Colour codes:

   FK - Foreground (ie ascii characters) black
   FR - Foreground red
   FG - Foreground green
   FY - Foreground yellow (or orange/brown depending on terminal)
   FB - Foreground blue
   FM - Foreground majenta (or purple depending on terminal)
   FT - Foreground turquoise
   FW - Foreground white
   BK - Background black
   BR - Background red
   BG - Background green
   BY - Background yellow
   BB - Background blue
   BM - Background majenta
   BT - Background turquoise
   BW - Background white

Internal NUTS codes:

 * IP - Set rest of string to be an inline prompt (eg "Mail>")
 * NP - Unset inline prompt and dump any text user was typing.
 * PR - Print normal prompt if inline prompt not set.


* indicates that this code is stripped from all user input before it is
processed and can only be used within the program code or externally created
files if the SYS_FLAG_STRIP_PRINTCODE flag is set (check using sysinfo
command). This is to prevent users from saying or writing text that could
mess up other users sessions or irritate them.
