~BM*** Unban ***

~FTUsage:~RS unban user/site <entry number>

This will remove the ban entry in the ban list given by the number. Entry
number is used instead of user id since there may be a local and numerous
remote users who all share the same id and having to specify ip address and
port aswell would be a pain in the backside. Site is specified by entry
number for consistency and ease of use.
