~BM*** Lsthreads ***

~FTUsage:~RS lsthreads

This lists all the current unix threads that the talker is using including
the main thread. The types are NUTS4 types but the thread id is that which
is returned by the OS and it varies wildly between *nixes. Currently this
command is for informational purposes only, you cannot directly affect the
threads from within the talker.
