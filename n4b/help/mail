~FTUsage:~RS mail [<sub command> [<arguments>]]

This command provides access to the mail system including the users mailbox
and for obvious reasons can only be used by local users. The mail sub system
has a number of sub commands you can use. To view them enter "help" when in
the mailer.
  Using the mail command will drop you info the mail sub system. If you 
provide command line arguments to it these will be treated as a sub command
plus its arguments and it will be run immediately after which you will be
at the "Mail>" prompt. If you provide no arguments you will be given a list
of the messages in the mailbox then dropped into the prompt (the equivalent
of entering "mail list").

eg: mail write 0eee hello world
    mail read from 1
