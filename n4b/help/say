~BM*** Say ***

~FTUsage:~RS say <text>

This is used to say something when the user is in command mode. It can also
be used in converse mode but theres not much point in doing so. If a user has
the NOSPEECH flag toggled on then they will not see the output of this command.
The output gets stored in the groups review buffer.
