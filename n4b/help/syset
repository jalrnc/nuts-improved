~BM*** Syset ***

~FTUsage:~RS syset <parameter> <time period> [seconds / minutes / hours / days]

This command sets various numeric system time parameters (but may be extended
in the future to cover non time parameters too). The parameters currently
are:
        "Ping interval",
        "Server timeout",
        "Connect timeout",
        "Linkdead timeout",
        "Login timeout",
        "Idle timeout"
        "Invite expire",
        "Board msg expire",
        "Autosave interval"

If you're wondering why this uses clearer multiple word options as opposed
to the obscure single word options in systoggle its because since I wrote
the systoggle command I've changed my mind about which is more important,
brevity or clarity.
