~FTUsage:~RS user create <id> <name> [<password>]
       user delete <id>
       user level  <id> <level>

This command allows you to create and delete users and modify their level.

Create:
This allows you to create a new user account. This is useful on private
systems that do not allow new users to create accounts for themselves
at the login prompt. If you set the id to zero the the server will create
a random id. If you do not give the password it will be set to the systems
default password.

Delete:
You can delete a user whether they are logged on or not. It will not delete
their data files but rename their data and board directories by adding .delN
on the end where N is a number. You cannot delete a remote user.

Level:
Modifying a users level is how users are promoted or demoted. You can
only promote a user up to your own level but BEWARE , you can only demote a
user who is LOWER than your own level. This means if you promote a user to
your level you cannot demote them again! One result of this is that to demote
an admin you would have to edit their configuration file manually from the unix
command line.

User levels are: novice, user, monitor, operator, admin

This option can be used on both local and remote users but for remotes the
effect only lasts while they are on the given server the level change was
done on.
