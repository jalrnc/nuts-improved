~BM*** Imprison ***

~FTUsage:~RS imprison <user id> [<sentence length> [seconds / minutes / hours / days]]

To shut a troublesome user up you can either muzzle them or use the less 
dramatic option which is to imprison them. This puts them into the prison
group (0003) and prevents them shouting and also prevents them leaving the
group until their sentence has run out. If no sentence is given then they
are there indefinitely until someone releases them.

eg: imprison 0622 10 minutes
