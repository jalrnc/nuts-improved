~BM*** Wake ***

~FTUsage:~RS wake <user id>

This command will send a wake message to the given user which appears to
them the same as a flashing tell saying "WAKE UP" except that it will beep
a number of times. Since the /~SN code is stripped from user input (due to
obvious scope for abuse) you cannot cause a beep with a normal tell. You can
only wake a user who is a lower level than yourself.
    Currently wakes can only be sent to local users since sending to a remote
user would necessitate finding out their level first to see if you are allowed
to wake them and this leads to all sorts of complexities which frankly are
not worth the effort for such a unimportant command.
