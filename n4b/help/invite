~FTUsage:~RS invite <user id> / friends

This command is used to either invite a specific user into your current group
or if passed the "friends" option it will invite all the friends in your 
friends list who are currently online. An invite expires after a system 
defined time period. You can only use this command in a group that is alredy
private, it cannot be used to pre-empt a currently public group being set to
private and you must have appropriate permissions to invite people into the
given group.
