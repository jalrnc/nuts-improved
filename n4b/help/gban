~BM*** Gban ***

~FTUsage:~RS gban <user id> [<group id>]

This allows you to ban a user from your current group or if a group id is
given from that particular group. Whether you have permissions to do this
depends on your level and the type of group. Users can never be banned from
system groups but can always be banned from your home group (though high level
users banned can gatecrash anyway) and you may be able to ban them from 
pubic groups depending on permissions.
